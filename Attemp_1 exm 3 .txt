Question 20: 
 
Flowlogistic Case Study -

Company Overview -
Flowlogistic is a leading logistics and supply chain provider. They help businesses throughout the world manage their resources and transport them to their final destination. The company has grown rapidly, expanding their offerings to include rail, truck, aircraft, and oceanic shipping.

Company Background -
The company started as a regional trucking company, and then expanded into other logistics market. Because they have not updated their infrastructure, managing and tracking orders and shipments has become a bottleneck. To improve operations, Flowlogistic developed proprietary technology for tracking shipments in real time at the parcel level. However, they are unable to deploy it because their technology stack, based on Apache Kafka, cannot support the processing volume. In addition, Flowlogistic wants to further analyze their orders and shipments to determine how best to deploy their resources.

Solution Concept -
Flowlogistic wants to implement two concepts using the cloud:
✑ Use their proprietary technology in a real-time inventory-tracking system that indicates the location of their loads
✑ Perform analytics on all their orders and shipment logs, which contain both structured and unstructured data, to determine how best to deploy resources, which markets to expand info. They also want to use predictive analytics to learn earlier when a shipment will be delayed.

Existing Technical Environment -
Flowlogistic architecture resides in a single data center:
✑ Databases
- 8 physical servers in 2 clusters
- SQL Server "" user data, inventory, static data
- 3 physical servers
- Cassandra "" metadata, tracking messages
10 Kafka servers "" tracking message aggregation and batch insert
✑ Application servers "" customer front end, middleware for order/customs
- 60 virtual machines across 20 physical servers
- Tomcat "" Java services
- Nginx "" static content
- Batch servers
✑ Storage appliances
- iSCSI for virtual machine (VM) hosts
- Fibre Channel storage area network (FC SAN) "" SQL server storage
Network-attached storage (NAS) image storage, logs, backups
✑ 10 Apache Hadoop /Spark servers
- Core Data Lake
- Data analysis workloads
✑ 20 miscellaneous servers
- Jenkins, monitoring, bastion hosts,

Business Requirements -
Build a reliable and reproducible environment with scaled panty of production.

✑ Aggregate data in a centralized Data Lake for analysis
✑ Use historical data to perform predictive analytics on future shipments
✑ Accurately track every shipment worldwide using proprietary technology
✑ Improve business agility and speed of innovation through rapid provisioning of new resources
✑ Analyze and optimize architecture for performance in the cloud
✑ Migrate fully to the cloud if all other requirements are met

Technical Requirements -
✑ Handle both streaming and batch data
✑ Migrate existing Hadoop workloads
✑ Ensure architecture is scalable and elastic to meet the changing demands of the company.
✑ Use managed services whenever possible
✑ Encrypt data flight and at rest
Connect a VPN between the production data center and cloud environment

SEO Statement -
We have grown so quickly that our inability to upgrade our infrastructure is really hampering further growth and efficiency. We are efficient at moving shipments around the world, but we are inefficient at moving data around.
We need to organize our information so we can more easily understand where our customers are and what they are shipping.

CTO Statement -
IT has never been a priority for us, so as our data has grown, we have not invested enough in our technology. I have a good staff to manage IT, but they are so busy managing our infrastructure that I cannot get them to do the things that really matter, such as organizing our data, building the analytics, and figuring out how to implement the CFO' s tracking technology.

CFO Statement -
Part of our competitive advantage is that we penalize ourselves for late shipments and deliveries. Knowing where out shipments are at all times has a direct correlation to our bottom line and profitability. Additionally, I don't want to commit capital to building out a server environment.
Flowlogistic's management has determined that the current Apache Kafka servers cannot handle the data volume for their real-time inventory tracking system.
You need to build a new system on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that will feed the proprietary tracking software. The system must be able to ingest data from a variety of global sources, process and query in real-time, and store the data reliably. Which combination of GCP products should you choose?

Your Spark job is a complicated analytical workload that consists of many shuffing operations and initial data are parquet files (on average 200-400 MB size each). You see some degradation in performance after the migration to Dataproc, so you'd like to optimize for it. You need to keep in mind that your organization is very cost-sensitive, so you'd like to continue using Dataproc on preemptibles (with 2 non-preemptible workers only) for this workload.
What should you do?

•	 
A. Increase the size of your parquet files to ensure them to be 1 GB minimum.
•	 
B. Switch to TFRecords formats (appr. 200MB per file) instead of parquet files.

D. Install the StackDriver Agent and configure the MySQL plugin.



Question 27: 
 
You work for a bank. You have a labelled dataset that contains information on already granted loan application and whether these applications have been defaulted. You have been asked to train a model to predict default rates for credit applicants.
What should you do?
•	 
A. Increase the size of the dataset by collecting additional data.
•	 
B. Train a linear regression to predict a credit default risk score.
•	 
C. Remove the bias from the data and collect applications that have been declined loans.
•	 
D. Match loan applicants with their social profiles to enable feature engineering.
 

Question 28: 
 
You need to migrate a 2TB relational database to Google Cloud Platform. You do not have the resources to significantly refactor the application that uses this database and cost to operate is of primary concern.
Which service do you select for storing and serving your data?

•	 
A. Cloud Spanner
•	 
B. Cloud Bigtable
•	 
C. Cloud Firestore
•	 
D. Cloud SQL


Question 29: 
 
You are designing an Apache Beam pipeline to enrich data from Cloud Pub/Sub with static reference data from BigQuery. The reference data is small enough to fit in memory on a single worker. The pipeline should write enriched results to BigQuery for analysis. Which job type and transforms should this pipeline use?

•	 
A. Batch job, PubSubIO, side-inputs
•	 
B. Streaming job, PubSubIO, JdbcIO, side-outputs
•	 
C. Streaming job, PubSubIO, BigQueryIO, side-inputs 
•	 
D. Streaming job, PubSubIO, BigQueryIO, side-outputs

Question 30: 
 
You have a data pipeline that writes data to Cloud Bigtable using well-designed row keys. You want to monitor your pipeline to determine when to increase the size of you Cloud Bigtable cluster. Which two actions can you take to accomplish this? (Choose two.)

•	 
A. Review Key Visualizer metrics. Increase the size of the Cloud Bigtable cluster when the Read pressure index is above 100.
•	 
B. Review Key Visualizer metrics. Increase the size of the Cloud Bigtable cluster when the Write pressure index is above 100.
•	 
C. Monitor the latency of write operations. Increase the size of the Cloud Bigtable cluster when there is a sustained increase in write latency.
•	 
D. Monitor storage utilization. Increase the size of the Cloud Bigtable cluster when utilization increases above 70% of max capacity.
•	 
E. Monitor latency of read operations. Increase the size of the Cloud Bigtable cluster of read operations take longer than 100 ms.
