Flowlogistic is a leading logistics and supply chain provider. They help businesses throughout the world manage their resources and transport them to their final destination. The company has grown rapidly, expanding their offerings to include rail, truck, aircraft, and oceanic shipping.

Company Background -
The company started as a regional trucking company, and then expanded into other logistics market. Because they have not updated their infrastructure, managing and tracking orders and shipments has become a bottleneck. To improve operations, Flowlogistic developed proprietary technology for tracking shipments in real time at the parcel level. However, they are unable to deploy it because their technology stack, based on Apache Kafka, cannot support the processing volume. In addition, Flowlogistic wants to further analyze their orders and shipments to determine how best to deploy their resources.

Solution Concept -
Flowlogistic wants to implement two concepts using the cloud:
✑ Use their proprietary technology in a real-time inventory-tracking system that indicates the location of their loads
✑ Perform analytics on all their orders and shipment logs, which contain both structured and unstructured data, to determine how best to deploy resources, which markets to expand info. They also want to use predictive analytics to learn earlier when a shipment will be delayed.

SEO Statement -
We have grown so quickly that our inability to upgrade our infrastructure is really hampering further growth and efficiency. We are efficient at moving shipments around the world, but we are inefficient at moving data around.
We need to organize our information so we can more easily understand where our customers are and what they are shipping.

CTO Statement -
IT has never been a priority for us, so as our data has grown, we have not invested enough in our technology. I have a good staff to manage IT, but they are so busy managing our infrastructure that I cannot get them to do the things that really matter, such as organizing our data, building the analytics, and figuring out how to implement the CFO' s tracking technology.

CFO Statement -
Part of our competitive advantage is that we penalize ourselves for late shipments and deliveries. Knowing where out shipments are at all times has a direct correlation to our bottom line and profitability. Additionally, I don't want to commit capital to building out a server environment.

Flowlogistic is rolling out their real-time inventory tracking system. The tracking devices will all send package-tracking messages, which will now go to a single
Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic instead of the Apache Kafka cluster. A subscriber application will then process the messages for real-time reporting and store them in
Google BigQuery for historical analysis. You want to ensure the package data can be analyzed over time.
Which approach should you take?




•	 
A. Attach the timestamp on each message in the Cloud Pub/Sub subscriber application as they are received.
•	 
B. Attach the timestamp and Package ID on the outbound message from each publisher device as they are sent to Clod Pub/Sub.
 
•	 
C. Use the NOW () function in BigQuery to record the event's time.
•	 
D. Use the automatically generated timestamp from Cloud Pub/Sub to order the data.

Company Overview -
MJTelco is a startup that plans to build networks in rapidly growing, underserved markets around the world. The company has patents for innovative optical communications hardware. Based on these patents, they can create many reliable, high-speed backbone links with inexpensive hardware.

Company Background -
Founded by experienced telecom executives, MJTelco uses technologies originally developed to overcome communications challenges in space. Fundamental to their operation, they need to create a distributed data infrastructure that drives real-time analysis and incorporates machine learning to continuously optimize their topologies. Because their hardware is inexpensive, they plan to overdeploy the network allowing them to account for the impact of dynamic regional politics on location availability and cost.
Their management and operations teams are situated all around the globe creating many-to-many relationship between data consumers and provides in their system. After careful consideration, they decided public cloud is the perfect environment to support their needs.

Solution Concept -
MJTelco is running a successful proof-of-concept (PoC) project in its labs. They have two primary needs:
✑ Scale and harden their PoC to support significantly more data flows generated when they ramp to more than 50,000 installations.
✑ Refine their machine-learning cycles to verify and improve the dynamic models they use to control topology definition.
MJTelco will also use three separate operating environments "" development/test, staging, and production "" to meet the needs of running experiments, deploying new features, and serving production customers.

Business Requirements -
✑ Scale up their production environment with minimal cost, instantiating resources when and where needed in an unpredictable, distributed telecom user community.
✑ Ensure security of their proprietary data to protect their leading-edge machine learning and analysis.
✑ Provide reliable and timely access to data for analysis from distributed research workers
✑ Maintain isolated environments that support rapid iteration of their machine-learning models without affecting their customers.

Technical Requirements -
✑ Ensure secure and efficient transport and storage of telemetry data
✑ Rapidly scale instances to support between 10,000 and 100,000 data providers with multiple flows each.
✑ Allow analysis and presentation against data tables tracking up to 2 years of data storing approximately 100m records/day
✑ Support rapid iteration of monitoring infrastructure focused on awareness of data pipeline problems both in telemetry flows and in production learning cycles.

CEO Statement -
Our business model relies on our patents, analytics and dynamic machine learning. Our inexpensive hardware is organized to be highly reliable, which gives us cost advantages. We need to quickly stabilize our large distributed data pipelines to meet our reliability and capacity commitments.

CTO Statement -
Our public cloud services must operate as advertised. We need resources that scale and keep our data secure. We also need environments in which our data scientists can carefully study and quickly adapt our models. Because we rely on automation to process our data, we also need our development and test environments to work as we iterate.

CFO Statement -
The project is too large for us to maintain the hardware and software required for the data and analysis. Also, we cannot afford to staff an operations team to monitor so many data feeds, so we will rely on automation and infrastructure. Google Cloud's machine learning will allow our quantitative researchers to work on our high-value problems instead of problems with our data pipelines.

✑ Refine their machine-learning cycles to verify and improve the dynamic models they use to control topology definition.
MJTelco will also use three separate operating environments "" development/test, staging, and production "" to meet the needs of running experiments, deploying new features, and serving production customers.

Business Requirements -
✑ Scale up their production environment with minimal cost, instantiating resources when and where needed in an unpredictable, distributed telecom user community.
✑ Ensure security of their proprietary data to protect their leading-edge machine learning and analysis.
✑ Provide reliable and timely access to data for analysis from distributed research workers
✑ Maintain isolated environments that support rapid iteration of their machine-learning models without affecting their customers.

Technical Requirements -
✑ Ensure secure and efficient transport and storage of telemetry data
✑ Rapidly scale instances to support between 10,000 and 100,000 data providers with multiple flows each.
✑ Allow analysis and presentation against data tables tracking up to 2 years of data storing approximately 100m records/day
✑ Support rapid iteration of monitoring infrastructure focused on awareness of data pipeline problems both in telemetry flows and in production learning cycles.

CEO Statement -
Our business model relies on our patents, analytics and dynamic machine learning. Our inexpensive hardware is organized to be highly reliable, which gives us cost advantages. We need to quickly stabilize our large distributed data pipelines to meet our reliability and capacity commitments.

CTO Statement -
Our public cloud services must operate as advertised. We need resources that scale and keep our data secure. We also need environments in which our data scientists can carefully study and quickly adapt our models. Because we rely on automation to process our data, we also need our development and test environments to work as we iterate.

CFO Statement -
The project is too large for us to maintain the hardware and software required for the data and analysis. Also, we cannot afford to staff an operations team to monitor so many data feeds, so we will rely on automation and infrastructure. Google Cloud's machine learning will allow our quantitative researchers to work on our high-value problems instead of problems with our data pipelines.

Question 18: 
 
Your company produces 20,000 files every hour. Each data file is formatted as a comma separated values (CSV) file that is less than 4 KB. All files must be ingested on Google Cloud Platform before they can be processed. Your company site has a 200 ms latency to Google Cloud, and your Internet connection bandwidth is limited as 50 Mbps. You currently deploy a secure FTP (SFTP) server on a virtual machine in Google Compute Engine as the data ingestion point. A local SFTP client runs on a dedicated machine to transmit the CSV files as is. The goal is to make reports with data from the previous day available to the executives by 10:00 a.m. each day. This design is barely able to keep up with the current volume, even though the bandwidth utilization is rather low.
You are told that due to seasonality, your company expects the number of files to double for the next three months. Which two actions should you take? (Choose two.)



•	 
A. Introduce data compression for each file to increase the rate file of file transfer.

•	 
B. Contact your internet service provider (ISP) to increase your maximum bandwidth to at least 100 Mbps.
•	 
C. Redesign the data ingestion process to use gsutil tool to send the CSV files to a storage bucket in parallel.
 
•	 
D. Assemble 1,000 files into a tape archive (TAR) file. Transmit the TAR files instead, and disassemble the CSV files in the cloud upon receiving them.
 
•	 
E. Create an S3-compatible storage endpoint in your network, and use Google Cloud Storage Transfer Service to transfer on-premises data to the designated storage bucket.

Question 19: 
 
You are choosing a NoSQL database to handle telemetry data submitted from millions of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. The volume of data is growing at 100TB per year, and each data entry has about 100 attributes. The data processing pipeline does not require atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID).
However, high availability and low latency are required.

Dataproc cluster, and depositing the results into Google BigQuery.
How should you securely run this workload?



•	 
A. Restrict the Google Cloud Storage bucket so only you can see the files
•	 
B. Grant the Project Owner role to a service account, and run the job with it
•	 
C. Use a service account with the ability to read the batch files and to write to BigQuery
 
•	 
D. Use a user account with the Project Viewer role on the Cloud Dataproc cluster to read the batch files and write to BigQuery

Question 22: 
 
Your globally distributed auction application allows users to bid on items. Occasionally, users place identical bids at nearly identical times, and different application servers process those bids. Each bid event contains the item, amount, user, and timestamp. You want to collate those bid events into a single location in real time to determine which user bid first. What should you do?

	 
A. Create a file on a shared file and have the application servers write all bid events to that file. Process the file with Apache Hadoop to identify which user bid first.
•	 
B. Have each application server write the bid events to Cloud Pub/Sub as they occur. Push the events from Cloud Pub/Sub to a custom endpoint that writes the bid event information into Cloud SQL.
 
•	 
C. Set up a MySQL database for each application server to write bid events into. Periodically query each of those distributed MySQL databases and update a master MySQL database with bid event information.
•	 
D. Have each application server write the bid events to Google Cloud Pub/Sub as they occur. Use a pull subscription to pull the bid events using Google Cloud Dataflow. Give the bid for each item to the user in the bid event that is processed first.


Question 23: 
 
Your organization has been collecting and analyzing data in Google BigQuery for 6 months. The majority of the data analyzed is placed in a time-partitioned table named events_partitioned. To reduce the cost of queries, your organization created a view called events, which queries only the last 14 days of data. The view is described in legacy SQL. Next month, existing applications will be connecting to BigQuery to read the events data via an ODBC connection. You need to ensure the applications can connect. Which two actions should you take? (Choose two.)

•	 
E. Create a Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (Cloud IAM) role for the ODBC connection and shared "events"

Question 24: 
 
You have enabled the free integration between Firebase Analytics and Google BigQuery. Firebase now automatically creates a new table daily in BigQuery in the format app_events_YYYYMMDD. You want to query all of the tables for the past 30 days in legacy SQL. What should you do?


•	 
A. Use the TABLE_DATE_RANGE function
  
B. Use the WHERE_PARTITIONTIME pseudo column
•	 
C. Use WHERE date BETWEEN YYYY-MM-DD AND YYYY-MM-DD
 
D. Use SELECT IF.(date >= YYYY-MM-DD AND date <= YYYY-MM-DD


Question 25: 
 
Your company is currently setting up data pipelines for their campaign. For all the Google Cloud Pub/Sub streaming data, one of the important business requirements is to be able to periodically identify the inputs and their timings during their campaign. Engineers have decided to use windowing and transformation in Google Cloud Dataflow for this purpose. However, when testing this feature, they find that the Cloud Dataflow job fails for the all streaming insert. What is the most likely cause of this problem?




•	 
A. They have not assigned the timestamp, which causes the job to fail
•	 
B. They have not set the triggers to accommodate the data coming in late, which causes the job to fail
•	 
C. They have not applied a global windowing function, which causes the job to fail when the pipeline is created
•	 
D. They have not applied a non-global windowing function, which causes the job to fail when the pipeline is created
 

Question 26: 
 
You architect a system to analyze seismic data. Your extract, transform, and load (ETL) process runs as a series of MapReduce jobs on an Apache Hadoop cluster. The ETL process takes days to process a data set because some steps are computationally expensive. Then you discover that a sensor calibration step has been omitted. How should you change your ETL process to carry out sensor calibration systematically in the future?




•	 
A. Modify the transformMapReduce jobs to apply sensor calibration before they do anything else.
•	 
B. Introduce a new MapReduce job to apply sensor calibration to raw data, and ensure all other MapReduce jobs are chained after this.
  
C. Add sensor calibration data to the output of the ETL process, and document that all users need to apply sensor calibration themselves.
•	 
D. Develop an algorithm through simulation to predict variance of data output from the last MapReduce job based on calibration factors, and apply the correction to all data.


Question 27: 
 
An online retailer has built their current application on Google App Engine. A new initiative at the company mandates that they extend their application to allow their customers to transact directly via the application.

Which Google Cloud database should they choose?



•	 
A. BigQuery
•	 
B. Cloud SQL  
•	 
C. Cloud BigTable
•	 
D. Cloud Datastore


Question 28: 
 
You launched a new gaming app almost three years ago. You have been uploading log files from the previous day to a separate Google BigQuery table with the table name format LOGS_yyyymmdd. You have been using table wildcard functions to generate daily and monthly reports for all time ranges. Recently, you discovered that some queries that cover long date ranges are exceeding the limit of 1,000 tables and failing. How can you resolve this issue?




•	 
A. Convert all daily log tables into date-partitioned tables
•	 
B. Convert the sharded tables into a single partitioned table
  
C. Enable query caching so you can cache data from previous months
