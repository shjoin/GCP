Company Background -
The company started as a regional trucking company, and then expanded into other logistics market. Because they have not updated their infrastructure, managing and tracking orders and shipments has become a bottleneck. To improve operations, Flowlogistic developed proprietary technology for tracking shipments in real time at the parcel level. However, they are unable to deploy it because their technology stack, based on Apache Kafka, cannot support the processing volume. In addition, Flowlogistic wants to further analyze their orders and shipments to determine how best to deploy their resources.

Solution Concept -
Flowlogistic wants to implement two concepts using the cloud:
✑ Use their proprietary technology in a real-time inventory-tracking system that indicates the location of their loads
✑ Perform analytics on all their orders and shipment logs, which contain both structured and unstructured data, to determine how best to deploy resources, which markets to expand info. They also want to use predictive analytics to learn earlier when a shipment will be delayed.

SEO Statement -
We have grown so quickly that our inability to upgrade our infrastructure is really hampering further growth and efficiency. We are efficient at moving shipments around the world, but we are inefficient at moving data around.
We need to organize our information so we can more easily understand where our customers are and what they are shipping.

CTO Statement -
IT has never been a priority for us, so as our data has grown, we have not invested enough in our technology. I have a good staff to manage IT, but they are so busy managing our infrastructure that I cannot get them to do the things that really matter, such as organizing our data, building the analytics, and figuring out how to implement the CFO' s tracking technology.

CFO Statement -
Part of our competitive advantage is that we penalize ourselves for late shipments and deliveries. Knowing where out shipments are at all times has a direct correlation to our bottom line and profitability. Additionally, I don't want to commit capital to building out a server environment.

SEO Statement -
We have grown so quickly that our inability to upgrade our infrastructure is really hampering further growth and efficiency. We are efficient at moving shipments around the world, but we are inefficient at moving data around.
We need to organize our information so we can more easily understand where our customers are and what they are shipping.

CTO Statement -
IT has never been a priority for us, so as our data has grown, we have not invested enough in our technology. I have a good staff to manage IT, but they are so busy managing our infrastructure that I cannot get them to do the things that really matter, such as organizing our data, building the analytics, and figuring out how to implement the CFO' s tracking technology.

CFO Statement -
Part of our competitive advantage is that we penalize ourselves for late shipments and deliveries. Knowing where out shipments are at all times has a direct correlation to our bottom line and profitability. Additionally, I don't want to commit capital to building out a server environment.
Flowlogistic's CEO wants to gain rapid insight into their customer base so his sales team can be better informed in the field. This team is not very technical, so they've purchased a visualization tool to simplify the creation of BigQuery reports. However, they've been overwhelmed by all the data in the table, and are spending a lot of money on queries trying to find the data they need. You want to solve their problem in the most cost-effective way. What should you do?
A. Export the data into a Google Sheet for virtualization.
B. Create an additional table with only the necessary columns.
C. Create a view on the table to present to the virtualization tool.
D. Create identity and access management (IAM) roles on the appropriate columns, so only they appear in a query.

Flowlogistic Case Study -

Company Overview -
Flowlogistic is a leading logistics and supply chain provider. They help businesses throughout the world manage their resources and transport them to their final destination. The company has grown rapidly, expanding their offerings to include rail, truck, aircraft, and oceanic shipping.

Company Background -
The company started as a regional trucking company, and then expanded into other logistics market. Because they have not updated their infrastructure, managing and tracking orders and shipments has become a bottleneck. To improve operations, Flowlogistic developed proprietary technology for tracking shipments in real time at the parcel level. However, they are unable to deploy it because their technology stack, based on Apache Kafka, cannot support the processing volume. In addition, Flowlogistic wants to further analyze their orders and shipments to determine how best to deploy their resources.

Solution Concept -
Flowlogistic wants to implement two concepts using the cloud:
✑ Use their proprietary technology in a real-time inventory-tracking system that indicates the location of their loads
✑ Perform analytics on all their orders and shipment logs, which contain both structured and unstructured data, to determine how best to deploy resources, which markets to expand info. They also want to use predictive analytics to learn earlier when a shipment will be delayed.

Existing Technical Environment -
Flowlogistic architecture resides in a single data center:
✑ Databases
8 physical servers in 2 clusters
- SQL Server `" user data, inventory, static data
3 physical servers
- Cassandra `" metadata, tracking messages
10 Kafka servers `" tracking message aggregation and batch insert
✑ Application servers `" customer front end, middleware for order/customs
60 virtual machines across 20 physical servers
- Tomcat `" Java services
- Nginx `" static content
- Batch servers
✑ Storage appliances
- iSCSI for virtual machine (VM) hosts
- Fibre Channel storage area network (FC SAN) `" SQL server storage
- Network-attached storage (NAS) image storage, logs, backups
✑ 10 Apache Hadoop /Spark servers
- Core Data Lake
- Data analysis workloads
✑ 20 miscellaneous servers
- Jenkins, monitoring, bastion hosts,

Flowlogistic is rolling out their real-time inventory tracking system. The tracking devices will all send package-tracking messages, which will now go to a single
Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic instead of the Apache Kafka cluster. A subscriber application will then process the messages for real-time reporting and store them in
Google BigQuery for historical analysis. You want to ensure the package data can be analyzed over time.
Which approach should you take?
A. Attach the timestamp on each message in the Cloud Pub/Sub subscriber application as they are received.
B. Attach the timestamp and Package ID on the outbound message from each publisher device as they are sent to Clod Pub/Sub.
C. Use the NOW () function in BigQuery to record the event's time.
D. Use the automatically generated timestamp from Cloud Pub/Sub to order the data.

MJTelco Case Study -

Company Overview -
MJTelco is a startup that plans to build networks in rapidly growing, underserved markets around the world. The company has patents for innovative optical communications hardware. Based on these patents, they can create many reliable, high-speed backbone links with inexpensive hardware.

Company Background -
Founded by experienced telecom executives, MJTelco uses technologies originally developed to overcome communications challenges in space. Fundamental to their operation, they need to create a distributed data infrastructure that drives real-time analysis and incorporates machine learning to continuously optimize their topologies. Because their hardware is inexpensive, they plan to overdeploy the network allowing them to account for the impact of dynamic regional politics on location availability and cost.
Their management and operations teams are situated all around the globe creating many-to-many relationship between data consumers and provides in their system. After careful consideration, they decided public cloud is the perfect environment to support their needs.

Solution Concept -
MJTelco is running a successful proof-of-concept (PoC) project in its labs. They have two primary needs:
✑ Scale and harden their PoC to support significantly more data flows generated when they ramp to more than 50,000 installations.
✑ Refine their machine-learning cycles to verify and improve the dynamic models they use to control topology definition.
MJTelco will also use three separate operating environments `" development/test, staging, and production `" to meet the needs of running experiments, deploying new features, and serving production customers.

Business Requirements -
✑ Scale up their production environment with minimal cost, instantiating resources when and where needed in an unpredictable, distributed telecom user community.
✑ Ensure security of their proprietary data to protect their leading-edge machine learning and analysis.
✑ Provide reliable and timely access to data for analysis from distributed research workers
✑ Maintain isolated environments that support rapid iteration of their machine-learning models without affecting their customers.

What is the most likely cause of the delay for this query?
A. Users are running too many concurrent queries in the system
B. The [myproject:mydataset.mytable] table has too many partitions
C. Either the state or the city columns in the [myproject:mydataset.mytable] table have too many NULL values
D. Most rows in the [myproject:mydataset.mytable] table have the same value in the country column, causing data skew  
 


Question #54Topic 1
Your globally distributed auction application allows users to bid on items. Occasionally, users place identical bids at nearly identical times, and different application servers process those bids. Each bid event contains the item, amount, user, and timestamp. You want to collate those bid events into a single location in real time to determine which user bid first. What should you do?
A. Create a file on a shared file and have the application servers write all bid events to that file. Process the file with Apache Hadoop to identify which user bid first.
B. Have each application server write the bid events to Cloud Pub/Sub as they occur. Push the events from Cloud Pub/Sub to a custom endpoint that writes the bid event information into Cloud SQL.  
C. Set up a MySQL database for each application server to write bid events into. Periodically query each of those distributed MySQL databases and update a master MySQL database with bid event information.

We need to organize our information so we can more easily understand where our customers are and what they are shipping.

CTO Statement -
IT has never been a priority for us, so as our data has grown, we have not invested enough in our technology. I have a good staff to manage IT, but they are so busy managing our infrastructure that I cannot get them to do the things that really matter, such as organizing our data, building the analytics, and figuring out how to implement the CFO' s tracking technology.

CFO Statement -
Part of our competitive advantage is that we penalize ourselves for late shipments and deliveries. Knowing where out shipments are at all times has a direct correlation to our bottom line and profitability. Additionally, I don't want to commit capital to building out a server environment.
Flowlogistic's management has determined that the current Apache Kafka servers cannot handle the data volume for their real-time inventory tracking system.
You need to build a new system on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that will feed the proprietary tracking software. The system must be able to ingest data from a variety of global sources, process and query in real-time, and store the data reliably. Which combination of GCP products should you choose?
A. Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Dataflow, and Cloud Storage
B. Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Dataflow, and Local SSD
C. Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud SQL, and Cloud Storage
D. Cloud Load Balancing, Cloud Dataflow, and Cloud Storage
E. Cloud Dataflow, Cloud SQL, and Cloud Storage
 


Question #84Topic 1
After migrating ETL jobs to run on BigQuery, you need to verify that the output of the migrated jobs is the same as the output of the original. You've loaded a table containing the output of the original job and want to compare the contents with output from the migrated job to show that they are identical. The tables do not contain a primary key column that would enable you to join them together for comparison.
What should you do?
A. Select random samples from the tables using the RAND() function and compare the samples.
B. Select random samples from the tables using the HASH() function and compare the samples.
C. Use a Dataproc cluster and the BigQuery Hadoop connector to read the data from each table and calculate a hash from non-timestamp columns of the table after sorting. Compare the hashes of each table.
D. Create stratified random samples using the OVER() function and compare equivalent samples from each table.

Question #87Topic 1
You've migrated a Hadoop job from an on-prem cluster to dataproc and GCS. Your Spark job is a complicated analytical workload that consists of many shuffling operations and initial data are parquet files (on average 200-400 MB size each). You see some degradation in performance after the migration to Dataproc, so you'd like to optimize for it. You need to keep in mind that your organization is very cost-sensitive, so you'd like to continue using Dataproc on preemptibles (with 2 non-preemptible workers only) for this workload.
What should you do?
A. Increase the size of your parquet files to ensure them to be 1 GB minimum.
B. Switch to TFRecords formats (appr. 200MB per file) instead of parquet files.
C. Switch from HDDs to SSDs, copy initial data from GCS to HDFS, run the Spark job and copy results back to GCS.
D. Switch from HDDs to SSDs, override the preemptible VMs configuration to increase the boot disk size.
